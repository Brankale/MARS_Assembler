## MARS Assembler
[MARS][1] is a lightweight interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in MIPS assembly language, intended for educational-level use with Patterson and Hennessy's Computer Organization and Design.

MARS has been jointly developed by [Pete Sanderson][4] (programming) and [Ken Vollmar][5] (details and paperwork).

## Download
There's no download link yet, you must compile the project by yourself.
You can download the original version at the [official website][6].

## Purpose of this repository
This repo has the goal of refactoring the code to meet the requirements of Java 8, and
adding or revamping existing features.

I did this project just for fun so don't expect I'll work full time on this project.

I'm open to pull request if anyone wants to contribute.

## Features included in this custom version
