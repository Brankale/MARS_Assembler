## MARS Assembler
[MARS][1] is a lightweight interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in MIPS assembly language, intended for educational-level use with Patterson and Hennessy's Computer Organization and Design.

MARS has been jointly developed by [Pete Sanderson][4] (programming) and [Ken Vollmar][5] (details and paperwork).

## Download

## Purpose of this repository
This repo has the goal of refactoring the code to meet the requirements of Java 8.
I don't think I'll accept any pull request, this is something I did just for fun and not because I want to constantly update the program.

If you want to contribute to the original project, you should talk with [them][8].
